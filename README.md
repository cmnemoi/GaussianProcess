# Gaussian Process

Repository containing the source code of our project for the ING1 course "Simulation Monte-Carlo" at CY Tech.

In this project we had to implement a Gaussian Process from scratch and apply it to a dataset following in a machine-learning fashion (train-test split and optimizing hyperparameters).
